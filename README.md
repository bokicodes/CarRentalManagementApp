Windows Forms Application made using C# and ADO.NET
You can log in as an admin (username: admin  password:password) or as an user (username: user password:password).
When you add new user he has a generic password: password123. You can add new cars to your list, make new rental records,
edit them, delete them, do whatever you want! The application has a database made with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
This is my first bigger project and I hope you like it!
