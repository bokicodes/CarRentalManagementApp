Windows Forms Application made using C# and ADO.NET
You can log in as an admin (username: admin  password:password) or as an user (username: user password:password).
When you add a new user he has a generic password: password123. 
You can manage cars by removing/editing/adding cars to your list.
You can manage rental records by adding, editing and deleting them. 
You can also manage users by adding new users, activating/deactivating their account and reseting their password to a generic one.
The application has a database made with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio which containts all data regarding users,
cars and rental records in the form of tables and their relationships.
This is my first bigger project and I hope you like it!
